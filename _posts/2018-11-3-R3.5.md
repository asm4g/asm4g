# How to install R 3.5 on ubuntu 16.04

Currently the default version of R in ubuntu 16.04 is 3.4. Some packages in bioconductor shows error messages on R 3.4 version.

[R 3.5.0 for Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1031597/r-3-5-0-for-ubuntu)

First step is removing all previous R related packages

```
dpkg -l | grep r-cran-
sudo apt-get remove r-cran-XXX

dpkg -l | grep r-base-
sudp apt-get remove r-base-XXX
```

Second step is adding PPA.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:marutter/rrutter3.5
sudo apt-get update
```

Now you can install R but don't intall `r-base` package.

```
sudo apt install r-api-3.5
```

And R will be installed in `/usr/bin/R`

## Setup R-studio server

To configure setting of R-studio server, you should modify the following files

```
/etc/rstudio/rserver.conf
/etc/rstudio/rsession.conf
```

One of the important parameters is `rsession-which-r`, which determine the version of installed R programe.

```
rsession-which-r=/usr/local/bin/R
```

And you can start and stop the server with following commands

```
$ sudo rstudio-server restart
$ sudo rstudio-server stop
```

## Install BiocManager 3.7

Currently (2018/11/3) you can install BiocManager 3.8 but `GenomicFeatures` package has error message. To install it, you need to downgrade BiocManager

```
> BiocManager::install(version = "3.7")
> BiocManager::install('GenomicFeatures', version = '3.7')
```

Even in R Studio, you can use the same commands for installing BioConductor packages.

## Install R kernel for jupyter notebook

```
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('IRkernel/IRkernel')
# or devtools::install_local('IRkernel-master.tar.gz')
IRkernel::installspec()  # to register the kernel in the current R installation
```

In R, you should install IRkernel to use R session in jupyter notebook
