# How to git commit inside vim editor

There are couple of vim plugins for using git commands inside vim.

- [vimagit](https://github.com/jreybert/vimagit)
- [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)

## vim-fugitive

Once you installed this package, you can use git commands using `G`commit, `G`it, `G`status commands.

But first you need to use `git add filename` in terminal. Typical tasks are `commit` and `push`, which can be done by `Gcommit` and `Gpush`.

```
Error detected while processing DirChanged Auto commands for "*":
E16: Invalid range: call rpcnotify(3, "python_chdir", v:event.cwd)
```

Currently, with neovim shows the above error messages. But the `commit` command seems working. And `Gpush` does not show any messages.

And `commit -a` is necessary in the case that there are multiple changes in the repository. Another similar command is `Gwrite`, which is effectively `git add`.

In vim, you can also look up helps on vim-fugitive by `:help fugitive`. There are `:Gcd`, `:Gstatus`, `:Gcommit [args]` commands.

If you keep using `Gwrite` or modify just one file, `Gcommit` does not need `-a` option.

## gitGutter

This plugin shows line-by-line status of the file. New lines have a sign on the right side as `+`

## vimagit

I did not use it before and do not have much information.
